develapsesnt of both groups of countries are closely bound up together. 
If food prices fall, meanufactuAng countries enjoy a short-lived iascreaoed 
utanard of living, but very soon they will fiwwd that the food exporting 
countries, largely turd 5valaped countries, will under the se coneitiana be 
unable to buy capital eqsipment from the wsnuf'acturing v+cusxtriea. Thus we 
see that the prosperity and dwvelopnant of bath depend to a large extent 
on maintaining reasonable and aQsgtate prices for he raw' materials and 
food which the undeveloped countries have to sell to the markets of the
