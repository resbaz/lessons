This repository contains the teaching materials used by the Research Bazaar.  

In many cases the directories in this repo simply contain a README file with a link to the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) lessons that we use. In other cases there are lessons that we have developed ourselves, or additional files that compliment the Software Carpentry materials.

There are a number of Software Carpentry lessons that are currently being developed that we would be interested in including in our courses:  

* IPython parallel intermediate lesson (see [lesson](https://github.com/cfriedline/bc/blob/swc-ipython-parallel-lesson/intermediate/python/05-ipython-parallel.md) and [pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/438/files))
* Python spatial mapping novice lesson (see [pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/387))
* Make intermediate lesson (see [lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/intermediate/make))
* Python multiprocessing intermediate lesson (see [lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/blob/master/intermediate/python/04-multiprocessing.md))
* Bioinformatics capstone example (see [issue](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/532))
* Medical imaging capstone example (see [pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/529))
* (There's also some useful [examples](https://github.com/rossant/ipython-minibook) of using IPython for parallel computing in the [IPython mini-book](http://ipython.rossant.net/))

Note that the materials in the Software Carpentry [bc repo](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc) are organised as follows:  

* The `gh-pages` branch has the complete, mature materials
* The `master` branch has materials that are still being refined, but are good enough to use as they are
* All other development is tracked via [issues](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pulls)


### Contributing new material

If you'd like to contribute new material to our lessons repo, follow these steps:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the lessons repository.
2. Create a new branch and make all your changes/edits on that branch (i.e. do not make your changes on the `master` branch, as this makes it difficult to merge later on). If your edits are for a particular discipline and bootcamp, make that explicit in the branch name (e.g. `2014-02-30-meteorology-bootcamp`).
3. Once you're done, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and we'll review your changes.

### Bootcamp resources

Software Carpentry has a very detailed [operations guide](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/operations.html) for running bootcamps, in addition to an [instructional video](http://vimeo.com/87241285) on how to create a bootcamp website.
