   PRESS STATEMENT

   MALCOLM FRASER:

                           November 25th, 1963

             DAIRY STABILIZATION


          Malcolm Fraser said at Port Fairy -

          Significant additions have been made to the stabilization 
   of the dairying industry over the last two or three years. When the new 
   stabilization plan was negotiated in 1962 the Commonwealth made an under- 
   taking that a £132M. bounty for butter and cheese would be available in 
   each of the five years. Up to that time it had been the Commonwealth's 
   position to make decisions on bounty year by year. The new arrangement 
   shows the industry where it stands for the full five years.

          For the year 1962/63 the Government introduced a new bounty 
   on the export of processed milk products. This bounty started at the rate 
   of £350,000 and proved so successful that it was raised to £M. for this 
   year. This new bounty on processed milk products has had two advantages. 
   It has reversed the trend in the export of these products which had been 
   falling for several years and which is now rising. It also prevented 
   increased quantities of milk products being converted to butter and
   cheese which would have had to be exported to the somewhat difficult 
   overseas markets.

          This new bounty has been quite remarkably successful. In 
   1961/62 the export of processed milk products had fallen to 3,849 tons in 
   terms of butter fat. In 1962/63 it had risen to 5,627 tons, which is an 
   increase of one-third in one year. The increase is attributed to the 
   bounty. These are indications that exports this year will be higher.

          If we translate this butter fat content into the actual 
   product we find that exports of sweetened powder milk product increased 
   from 28,000 to 35,000 tons, thus reversing the downward trend that had 
   been present since 1956/57. Exports of sweetened preserved milk product 
   increased from 16,000 to 24,000 tons. Exports of other milk products 
   also increased.
•         These are just two examples to show how the new bounty 
   has operated to the advantage of the industry and to the advantage of 
   Australia because additional overseas funds have been earned.
