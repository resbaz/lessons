               TELEVISION TRANSLATORS



             Last week, the Postmaster-General introduced a 
    Bill into the House of Representatives which will make it possible 
    for rural television stations to establish translators: This is a 
•   technical term that will, in fact, enable a television station to 
    establish a small booster station so that its signal may be strengthened 
    in an area where first-class reception is not received.

             These translator stations,could not be used in an 
    area that can support its own television station but there are many 
    small pockets in Australia which are not now getting good television 
    coverage and which would not support a full commercial television station.

             The legislation introduced by the Postmaster-General 
    will make it possible for these small areas to be given a first-class 
    television service by existing country television stations.

             I hcpe that the Ballarat Television Station BTV 6 
    will be given an opportunity to apply for a translator station to 
    strengthen the signal into Warrnarnbool and further west into the 
    Portland and Casterton areas,
