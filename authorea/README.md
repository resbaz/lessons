## Authorea lesson plan

This course will aim to teach the basic functionality of [Authorea](https://authorea.com/) for scientists engaged in 
collaborative manuscript writing. 

The notes here are for a two hour workshop with a break in between.

### Part 1: Authorea in context

Discuss Authorea in the context of other online editors and it's place in the open science movement as an
alternative pre-print server. This is all covered in [this post](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/88732843274/authorea-a-review).

Points to convey:
* Most authors are used to Microsoft Word. Not ideal for collaborative documents.
* Track changes, bibliography and cross referencing is a pain.
* Math formula in Word is clumsy.
* LaTex and Authorea could be a solution. Git in the background.
* Point to decision [flow diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JQA6NyItxiKtkmGBWiGL9Bqk0asU064Cr3FF1ZT_nq8/edit#slide=id.p).
