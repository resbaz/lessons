                            PERSONAL PLEDGE FROM MALCOLM FRASER TO THE PEOPLE OF WANNON

                                                    At each election campaign I have made a personal 
                          promise to work as hard as possible in the interests of every 
                          person in this electorate. Now, at the close of the 1963 campaign, I renew
                          that pledge.                  If returned as your representative on November 
                          30th, I promise to work for you, for this great electorate 
                          and for Australia in the future as I have tried to do in the 
                          past.
